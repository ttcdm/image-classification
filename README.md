A continuation of the machine learning project I made during my time at the Oxford Scholar's Programme

To run, run pp10_3.py.
Modify the contents accordingly, i.e., the paths used for training/validation data (tpath, vpath, etc.).
pp10_3 uses a Nvidia GPU, so either use pp10_2 or pp10_1, which should only use the GPU.
Also, you can switch between training and testing modes near the top of the file by changing a variable named "mode".
Lastly, use camera2.py to use the camera and press the key "a" on your keyboard to run the current frame through the model, and the results will then show up in the console.
